# DMKDproject

## Dockerfile:
- *dockerfile:* dockerfile necessary to build the proper docker image for the project.  

## Script:
- *Project_I.ipynb:* Association Rules in a Temporal Transactions Dataset.
- *Project_I_rem.ipynb:* Association Rules in a Temporal Transactions Dataset slightly modified to better match the project guideline. 
- *Project_II.ipynb:* Conformal Based Classifier and Text Mining. 

## Dataset:
- *Online_Retail.xlsx:* dataset used for the first project (rules extraction). 
- *res0.5.csv:* test results of the classifiers generated with 50% (0.5) of the original dataset.
- *test_smpl0.5.csv:* test-set used to test the classifiers cited above.
- *train_smpl0.5.csv:* training-set used to generated the classifiers cited above.   
- *xtrain_obfuscated.txt:* dataset of obfuscated textual instances used for the second project.
- *ytrain.txt:* dataset of labels used for the second project (associated with the previous dataset).

**NB:** In order to train a new set of classifiers with a sampled datset representing the 50% (0.5) of the original dataset is necessary to delete or rename *res0.5.csv* and optionally both *test_smpl0.5.csv* and *train_smpl0.5.csv*.
